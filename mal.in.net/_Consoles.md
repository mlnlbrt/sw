# Retro gaming corner

Growing up in 90s and 00s I wanted to play games I've seen in magazines and played by my friends. Over the years I've built a humble collection of gaming hardware to fulfill my childhood dreams.

To avoid clutter and make things accessible, I came up with an idea of a retro gaming corner. Since it's focused on 90s and 00s, a CRT TV is an essential part. I've build the whole thing around an IKEA BESTÃ… cabinet.

## What's inside

- NTSC-J Sega Mega Drive 2 (HAA-2502) + Mega EverDrive X3
- NTSC-J Sega Saturn (HST-3220) + Terraonion MODE
- NTSC-J Nintendo 64 + EverDrive 64 X7
- PAL Sega Dreamcast (HKT-3030 VA1) + GDEMU
- PAL Sony PlayStation 2 (SCPH-50004) + Network Adapter
- PAL Nintendo Wii (RVL-001)
- MiSTer (Ultimate BlisSTer PRO)


## Why Japanese consoles?

Japanese eBay sellers offer gaming hardware in near-perfect condition for pennies, usually Complete In Box. If a box or instruction is missing, it's even cheaper. They also have accessories which are non-existent in the West, like Saturn Twin-Stick or Sega Virtua Gun.


## Voltage differences for the imported consoles

Since the Mega Drive and the Nintendo 64 don't have built-in power supplies, I just got European bricks and used them instead of the original ones. For the Saturn I bought an [230/110V 30VA step-down autotransformer](https://sklep.toroidy.pl/en_US/p/ATSS0030-230110V-30VA-step-down-autotransformer-plastic-housing%2C-1-outlet/204). I believe it's dedicated for audio equipment, but it works with the Saturn nonetheless.


## Power distribution and cable management

It took me a long time to find a power strip with an option to control each outlet separately, but [I finally got one](https://ibizashop.eu/gb/accessoires/493-LC806S-DE-5420047143945.html). Only the system I'm playing on at the moment gets the power.

As you may guess, there is a LOT of cables. To keep them organized, I riveted plastic cable trays to the back of the cabinet and made a few holes to get the cables through.


## Connecting multiple consoles to a single TV

Initally I got a [MINI HYDRA](https://lotharek.pl/productdetail.php?id=320) automatic SCART switch. I chose it over a regular Hydra, since I wanted a headphone output. As more consoles came in, I got a [Vivanco SBX 84](https://www.radiomuseum.org/r/vivanco_sbx84.html) manual switch and connected it in series to one of the Hydra's inputs. This combo makes the A/V management semi-automatic.
